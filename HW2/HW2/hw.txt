"How do the two algorithms differ...":
mazestack is depth first, using a stack - it searches around the most recent coordinate that was entered, ignoring the other's until a particular path is exhausted of possibilities; searches one path quickly
mazequeue is breadth first, using a queue - it searches around the least recent coordinate that was entered, basically going in concentric circles (in order of N E S W); searches multiple pathes at an equal rate
